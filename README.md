# haiku_bot 

A short script I have deployed and scheduled on PythonAnywhere. 
It posts one randomized tweet daily under twitter.com/haiku_septem

Before using, you must have a developer account on Twitter to access the API.
It is also recommended that you create a virtual environment. As for the packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
